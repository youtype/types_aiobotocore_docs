## Client

### Implicit type annotations

Can be used with `types-aiobotocore[lookoutequipment]` package installed.

Write your `LookoutEquipment` code as usual,
type checking and code completion should work out of the box.



=== "Client"

    ```python title="Client usage example"
    from aiobotocore.session import get_session


    session = get_session()

    async with session.create_client("lookoutequipment") as client:  # (1)
        result = await client.create_dataset()  # (2)
    ```

    1. client: [LookoutEquipmentClient](./client.md)
    2. result: [:material-code-braces: CreateDatasetResponseTypeDef](./type_defs.md#createdatasetresponsetypedef) 






### Explicit type annotations

With `types-aiobotocore-lite[lookoutequipment]`
or a standalone `types_aiobotocore_lookoutequipment` package, you have to explicitly specify
`client: LookoutEquipmentClient` type annotation.

All other type annotations are optional, as types should be discovered automatically.
However, these type annotations can be helpful in your functions and methods.


=== "Client"

    ```python title="Client usage example"
    from aiobotocore.session import get_session

    from types_aiobotocore_lookoutequipment.client import LookoutEquipmentClient
    from types_aiobotocore_lookoutequipment.type_defs import CreateDatasetResponseTypeDef
    from types_aiobotocore_lookoutequipment.type_defs import CreateDatasetRequestRequestTypeDef


    session = get_session()

    async with session.create_client("lookoutequipment") as client:
        client: LookoutEquipmentClient
        kwargs: CreateDatasetRequestRequestTypeDef = {...}
        result: CreateDatasetResponseTypeDef = await client.create_dataset(**kwargs)
    ```
