    type annotations stubs module [types-aiobotocore-marketplace-agreement](https://pypi.org/project/types-aiobotocore-marketplace-agreement/).

## Client

### Implicit type annotations

Can be used with `types-aiobotocore[marketplace-agreement]` package installed.

Write your `AgreementService` code as usual,
type checking and code completion should work out of the box.



#### Client method usage example

```python
# AgreementServiceClient usage example

from aiobotocore.session import get_session


session = get_session()

async with session.create_client("marketplace-agreement") as client:  # (1)
    result = await client.describe_agreement()  # (2)
```

1. client: [AgreementServiceClient](./client.md)
2. result: [:material-code-braces: DescribeAgreementOutputTypeDef](./type_defs.md#describeagreementoutputtypedef)






### Explicit type annotations

With `types-aiobotocore-lite[marketplace-agreement]`
or a standalone `types_aiobotocore_marketplace_agreement` package, you have to explicitly specify
`client: AgreementServiceClient` type annotation.

All other type annotations are optional, as types should be discovered automatically.
However, these type annotations can be helpful in your functions and methods.


#### Client method usage example

```python
# AgreementServiceClient usage example with type annotations

from aiobotocore.session import get_session

from types_aiobotocore_marketplace_agreement.client import AgreementServiceClient
from types_aiobotocore_marketplace_agreement.type_defs import DescribeAgreementOutputTypeDef
from types_aiobotocore_marketplace_agreement.type_defs import DescribeAgreementInputTypeDef


session = get_session()

async with session.create_client("marketplace-agreement") as client:
    client: AgreementServiceClient
    kwargs: DescribeAgreementInputTypeDef = {...}
    result: DescribeAgreementOutputTypeDef = await client.describe_agreement(**kwargs)
```
